# SQL-Projects

## SQL Data Analysis Projects Repository üíª

This repository contains a collection of **Data Analysis Projects** executed entirely using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. These projects demonstrate a professional proficiency in leveraging advanced SQL features for end-to-end data processing, analysis, and insight generation.

## Project Workflow & SQL Expertise Showcase üõ†Ô∏è

Each project follows a rigorous data analysis lifecycle, primarily utilizing the power and flexibility of SQL for every stage:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation üßπ
* **Data Integrity:** Identifying and handling nulls, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting using `CASE` statements and standard cleansing functions.
* **Data Transformation:** Employing functions for type casting, string manipulation, and date/time formatting to ensure analysis readiness.
* **Case Logic:** Extensive use of the `CASE WHEN` statement for creating calculated flags, categories, and business rule implementations directly within queries.

### 2. Data Modeling and Structuring üèóÔ∏è
* **Temporary Structures:** Utilizing **Temporary Tables (`#TempTables`)** to break down complex processing steps, store intermediate results, and improve query readability and performance.
* **Reusable Logic:** Implementing **Common Table Expressions (`CTE`s)** for modularizing complex logic, enhancing query flow, and simplifying multi-step aggregations.
* **Virtual Tables:** Creating **Views** to abstract complex query logic, enforce consistency, and provide simplified data interfaces for reporting tools.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Transformation üîç
* **Filtering and Aggregation:** Mastering standard `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses to segment and summarize data.
* **Advanced Joins:** Expert application of various `JOIN` types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and Self-Joins) to seamlessly integrate data from disparate tables.
* **Subqueries:** Using **Subqueries** (or inner queries) in `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses for sequential data retrieval and complex filtering conditions.
* **Window Functions:** Advanced use of **Window Functions** (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, and aggregate functions with `PARTITION BY`) for sophisticated comparative analysis, rolling calculations, and calculating running totals and percentiles.

### 4. Extracting Insights and Reporting üí°
* **Metric Calculation:** Developing custom metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) through complex aggregations and calculated fields.
* **Trend Identification:** Querying data to reveal long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and cohort performance.
* **Justification of Findings:** All derived insights are directly traceable back to the source data via the executed SQL queries, ensuring **accuracy and auditability**.

## Repository Structure and Navigation üó∫Ô∏è

Each project is contained within a dedicated folder and includes the following files:

1.  **`Data_Source_file`**: A (CSV/xlsx file) of the tables and columns used in the project.
2.  **`Project_Queries.sql`**: The primary file containing all the sequenced SQL scripts (separated by comments) that perform the cleaning, modeling, EDA, and final insight extraction.


---

## Technical Environment and Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

The SQL scripts in this repository are primarily written using standard T-SQL syntax (compatible with **Microsoft SQL Server**) but are generally transferable to other modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) like PostgreSQL or MySQL with minor syntax adjustments.
